# todo-web
A Simple todo app that runs in the browser. This project does not have any external dependencies.

## Bugs:

- A deleted to-do item will re-appear on reload
- Pressing Enter at the input box cannot add the item

## Tasks:

1. Show me you can read code and produce good clean code
2. Fix the above bugs
3. list.js and item.js are in different styles. Try to compare and unify
   (okay to just think of direction within time, we can discuss it later)
4. Any refactoring you think will make the code better,
   reduce the chance to produce above bugs

## Constraints

- You are not allowed to import any external libraries
- Time limit is 1 hr
- Commits should be atomic

## Evaluation

- We look for clean code
- We look for maintainable code
- How you fix the problems is more important than how fast you fix them
